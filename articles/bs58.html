<h1>High Performance Base58 Encoding For Dummies</h1>

<div class="section">* * *</div>

<p>
    This post is adapted from notes that I took trying to understand the <a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/"> Firedancer</a> team's 
    optimized implementation of base58 encoding. 
    The source code can be found here: 
    <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/pull/75">

<h3>
    What is base58 encoding?
</h3>
<p> 
    Encoding is the process of transforming some binary data into a sequence of printable characters. 
    Base58 encoding is a specific encoding scheme that is intended to be easy for humans to read and/or verify. 
    It is commonly used in blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Solana.
    The base58 alphabet consists of the following characters: 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Lou-Kamades/2b2f440648057425f5732cb79417c28b.js"></script>
   <p>
    Note that this is just all 62 alphanumeric characters without characters that are easily mistaken by humans – uppercase O, 0 (zero), lowercase l (L), uppercase I (i).
    While base58 is widely used in blockchains, it is commonly known that base58 encoding is not very performant.
</p>

<h3>
    Why do we care?
</h3>

<p>
    Performance is important if blockchains are ever going to be used in the real world.
    Base58 encoding is widely used across Solana, especially in 
    <a href="https://docs.solana.com/api/http">RPC nodes</a>.
    As identified by the Firedancer team, 
    <a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/29980">
        base58’s slowness is a potential performance bottleneck 
    </a> for Solana.
    Trying to understand their optimized implementation of base58 encoding taught me a lot about high performance computing and encoding in general 
    and it seemed worthwhile to record some of my notes in this post.  
    We’ll take a close look at their base58 implementation, but first we will look at the bs58 library that is currently used in Solana and integer base conversions in general.</p>

<h3>
    Encoding and base representations of integers
</h3>

<p>
    As stated earlier, encoding is just a procedure for representing some binary data as a sequence of characters. 
    In the case of base58, there are 58 characters available. 
    Therefore, as long as we represent our binary data (which is really just an integer) in terms of integers from 0-57, the base58 encoded string can be easily constructed by using
    each integer to index into the character table above.
</p>
<p>
    The problem then becomes: how to convert some number that is represented as binary into base58?
    Luckily for us, thanks the to the power of <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/BaseExpansion.shtml"> mathematics</a> 
    we know that ANY integer can be expressed in ANY <a href = "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(mathematics)"> base</a>.
    As an example, let's look at how 4875 is represented in different bases:
</p>
<p>
   base10:  \(4875 =  (10^3 * 4) + (10^2 * 8) + (10 * 7) + 5 = [4,8,7,5]\) 
</p>
<p>
   base58: \(4875 =  (58^2 * 1) + (58 * 26) + 3  = [1, 26, 3]\)
</p>
<p>
   base256: \(4875 =  (256 * 19) + 11 = [19,11]\)
</p>
<p>
    From these examples, hopefully the procedure for converting a base representation into a number is clear.
    Multiply each element of the representation by the base raised to a power and take the sum.
    The power is determined by the position of the element in a 0-indexed array.
    A <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big endian</a> formula for this would be: 
</p>
<p>
    \(X =  \sum_{i=0}^n array_i * base^{n-1-i}\)
</p>
    Now, how do we convert a number back into a base representation? 
    It's surprisingly simple, all we need to do is repeatedly divide by the base while taking the remainder at each step as elements in the representation.
    Let's convert 4875 to base58:
</p>
<p>
    \(4875 \bmod 58 =  3\) and \(\frac{4875}{58} = 84\) 
</p>
<p>
    \(84 \bmod 58 =  26\) and \(\frac{84}{58} = 1\) 
</p>
<p>
    \(1 \bmod 58 =  1\) and \(\frac{1}{58} = 0\) 
</p>
<p>
    \( => [1,26,3]\) 
</p>
<p>
    The important takeaway is that we can represent any integer in a variety of bases. 
    "Numbers" are abstract and constant, while base representations are concrete and can be changed as we please.
    4875 = 4875 in all of these examples, however we can represent this number as 4875, [1,26,3] or [19,11] depending on the base. 
</p>

<h3>
    The bs58 crate (used in Solana)
</h3>
<p>
Now that there’s some intuition about what a base conversion <i>means</i>, let’s look at how we might convert an arbitrary array of bytes into base58. 
Specifically we will look at the bs58 crate that Solana uses.
The full source code can be found
<a href = "https://github.com/Nullus157/bs58-rs/blob/2b0d73b9955f6a745f9b6fbb387bba2b96ea89fd/src/encode.rs#L434">here,</a>
but we are interested in:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Lou-Kamades/7a57b391786ccfbd25623af5dd63537b.js"></script>

<p>
    This looks a little more complicated than just converting between base representations of a number
    but that is <b>exactly</b> what this algorithm does, with a slight twist.
     I like to think of this algorithm as having 2 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>convert byte representation to a number</li>
    <li>convert the number back into base58</li>
</ol>
<p>
    If it's that easy, then why isn't the code simpler? 
    Couldn't we just convert the number's base the same way we did above?
    Unfortunately, we cannot do this because if we have a large number of bytes our number might <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" >overflow</a>.
    Avoiding overflow seems to be the main reason why the algorithm ingests bytes 1 at a time.
    This is the source of the code's complexity. 
</p>
<p>
    For each input byte, we first need to convert it to a number (step #1). 
    In Rust each byte is a u8 \( => 2^8 = 256. \)
    So, to convert the input byte to a number we must multiply by 256 (line 9).
    Note that because the algorithm ingests 1 byte at a time, for each additional byte ingested, 
    the output bytes also be multiplied by 256 to reflect the new power of the byte (line 10).
    It's the same base -> number process as before, it just looks a little different because the algorithm iterates over 1 byte at a time.
</p>
<p>
    Now for step #2 we need to convert the number into base58.
    This means simply divide it by 58 and save the remainder at each step of the way.
    Again, since the algorithm ingests bytes sequentially, division by 58 happens in lines 11 
    (to reset pre-existing output bytes as new bytes are ingested) and lines 17-20.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have an array of numbers from 0-57, then it’s trivial to map them into characters.
</p>
<p>
    This algorithm is nice for a a couple of reasons, it can encode an arbitrary number of bytes and in benchmarks it performs well compared to other base58 encoding crates.
    However, base58 encoding is still slow! This is a \( O(n^2) \) algorithm, where n = 32 or 64.
</p>

<h3>
    Firedancer version
</h3>
<p>
    Let's take a look at the optimized base58 algorithm created by the Firedancer team. 
    It’s important to note that this algorithm only supports 32 and 64 byte arrays. 
    This is appropriate for Solana, since ed25519 keys are represented using 32 bytes and transaction signatures are represented using 64 bytes. 
    Pubkeys and transaction signatures are everywhere -- it's pretty reasonable to expect that an RPC or validator would run faster if it spends less time encoding bytes. 
    RPCs can also return some account data in base58 format but imo this should probably be removed since it’s so inefficient. 
    At present, the returned base58 data is already 
    <a href = "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/3646291dc60112d2f67d009de44ca3f77e71c3e1/account-decoder/src/lib.rs#L99">limited to 128 bytes</a>.
</p>

<p>
The optimized algorithm is essentially the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>convert the input u8 array into a u32 array</li>
    <li>convert the u32 array into an intermediate format </li>
    <li>convert intermediate format into base58</li>
    <li>create the string</li>
    </ol>
<p>
At the heart of the optimization is a very clever choice of the intermediate format. 
Make sure to pay attention to the comments throughout. 
The “X = …” comments are especially helpful for demonstrating how each individual step is
 just a change in the number X’s base.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Lou-Kamades/5cf6d6da1135e012df432fdf9c0d1f94.js"></script>

<p>
    The first step is pretty straightforward, it just converts 4 u8s into a u32. 
    A u32 doesn’t waste any space in CPU registers and it allows the algorithm to do less work overall since it operates on a [u32; 8] instead of [u8; 32].
    Now let's look at step 2:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Lou-Kamades/bde342598513b51b88f5635af1c85695.js"></script>

<p>
    Per the comment, the intermediate format is base \(58^5\). 
    Why? 
    It turns out that \(58^5\) is the largest power of 58 that fits into a u32. 
    There are 2 constraints when choosing an intermediate format. 
    It must be amenable to dividing by 58, but at the same time fit inside a u32. 
    This makes \(58^5\) a great choice. This will become even clearer when we look at the conversion into base58 (step 3). 
</p>
<p>
    An encoding table is used to make the conversion into the intermediate format easier. 
    We want to go convert:
</p>
<p>
    \(X =  \sum_{i=0}^n binary_i * 2^{32*(n-1-i)}\)
</p>
<p>
    Into:
</p>
<p>
    \(X = \sum_{i=0}^n intermediate_i * 58^{5*(n-1-i)} \)
</p>
<p>
Instead of multiplying each input element by \(2^{8*i}\) and dividing by \(58^j\) like in the bs58 crate algorithm, 
we are going to multiply by \(2^{32*i}\) and divide by \(58^{5*j}\). 
The table just precomputes the different permutations of \(\frac{2^{32*i}}{58^{5*j}}\), so less work needs to be done in each iteration. 
This optimization is only possible due to the fixed sizes of the inputs. 
Otherwise, we might need a massive encoding table!
After we’ve converted to the intermediate format, it’s time to convert into base58 (step 3):
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Lou-Kamades/8e662726bf824ed982541f4b397f1b60.js"></script>
<p>

Here, the algorithm takes each intermediate value and assigns 5 elements in the output array at a time.
It assigns the result of division by different powers of 58.
The “ILP'' in the comment stands for instruction level parallelism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism . 
ILP is a CPU optimization where multiple instructions are executed at the same time. 
In the case of the above code, ILP means that theoretically the CPU can write 4-5 bytes of the raw_base58 output array in parallel! 
This is a significant theoretical speedup and ultimately we see some of this reflected in the improved performance of the algorithm. 
As always, the last step is conversion of the raw base58 array into a String.
</p>

<p>
So now that we know what the algorithm is doing, why is it faster? 
Overall, the performance gains come down to doing less work and being smarter about the work that is done. 
Specifically:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The computational complexity is still \( O(n^2) \), but using u32 instead of u8 gives n = 8 (or 16 in the case of 64 bytes) vs. 32/64 (less work)
    </li>
    <li>
        Choosing \(58^5\) as the intermediate format allows us to take care of 4-5 bytes at once when converting to base58 (smarter work)
    </li>
    <li>
        Using an encoding table saves computation (less work) and in some cases the compiler may parallelize table lookups (smarter work)
    </li>
</ol>
    <p>
        When it’s all said and done, this algorithm is roughly 9x faster than the bs58 crate currently used in Solana. Not too shabby!
    </p>
<p>
    It’s worth noting that this explanation skipped some steps present in the original algorithm. 
    They mostly have to do with preventing overflows but if you're interested, check out the original

<h3>
    Final comments
</h3>

<p>
    While this deep dive into base58 encoding got pretty low level, somehow it still just scratches the surface of the high-performance code the Firedancer team is writing. 
    The level of optimization in their code is very impressive – 
    I didn’t even cover how they take advantage of AVX instructions (seen within the same PR). 
    On top of that, this post only focused on 1 niche encoding algorithm. 
    There are many other optimized algorithms coming out of Firedancer such as: 
    <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/pull/778">SHA256</a>,  
    <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/pull/244">Reed Solomon Encoding</a>, or

<!-- <h6> Fun facts</h6>

<p>
    ** Basic benchmarking shows that a single base58 encoding takes around the same time as roughly 87 base64 encodings. 
</p>

<p>
**The length of the base58 encoded string is bounded and we can compute the length as: ceil(log_58(256^N - 1)), where N = the number of bytes.

I like to think of this formula/bound as "For the largest number that can be represented by N bytes, how many times do I need to divide by 58 to get to 0?".
